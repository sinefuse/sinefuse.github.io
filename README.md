# sinefuse.github.io

My own personal website, built on the fundamental structure of tgmguide.github.io.

As such, this website is based on [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) (with modifications to the CSS and the template pages), which in turn is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Therefore, the site is licensed under the MIT license, as Lanyon also is licensed under the same license. Feel free to make your own fork for yourself.

## How do I run this?

Download the repository open cmd, navigate into the repo folder in the command line you have and run `jekyll serve`. from here on you can edit the markdown files and preview them on `localhost:4000`. Once you're done with editing, be sure to run `jekyll build` to make sure you can deploy your site properly.
