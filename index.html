	<h2>Hello, my name is sinefuse (as in sine fuse).</h2>
	<p>I'm 23 years old and from Germany. While I was born male, I don't really care about my gender a lot, so feel free to use any pronouns for me.</p>
	<br />
	<p>I do and have done lots of different things already, mostly on the creative side - from photo editing to making experimental music using a Game Boy. I also enjoy playing very hard video games and messing around with my own original characters that I have created. You can read more about those in the "Characters" page at the top.</p>

	<p>You can mainly find me on GitHub, Twitch and Twitter (where my username is "sinefuse" on all 3 of these platforms), although I don't really like using Twitter much. I do have a Discord account too, but that's only really reserved for important things. You might as well just send me a Twitter message, honestly.</p>
