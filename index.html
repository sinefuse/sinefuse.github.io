	<h2>Hello, my name is sinefuse (as in "sine-fuse").</h2>
	<p>I'm 23 years old and from Germany. While I was born male, I don't really care about my gender a lot, so feel free to use any pronouns for me.</p>
	<p>I do and have done lots of different things already, mostly on the creative side - from photo editing to making experimental music using a Game Boy. I also enjoy playing very hard video games and messing around with my own original characters that I have created. You can read more about those in the "Characters" page at the top.</p>
	<p>You can mainly find me here:</p>
