# Hello, I'm sinefuse!

<br/>
I'm 23 years old and from Germany. While I was born male, I don't really care about my gender a lot, so feel free to use any pronouns for me.

I do and have done lots of different things already, mostly on the creative side - from photo editing to making experimental music using a Game Boy. Every now and then, I do tackle other random challenges, such as making things like this website.

Here's a bunch of places you can find me at:

Soundcloud:

Discord: sinefuse#8888 - please only contact me here if it's very urgent!
