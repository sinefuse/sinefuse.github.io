	<h2>My thoughts on the Kyria and split boards moving forward</h2>
	<h3>// 2021-06-24</h3>
	<p>This small ramble is about my thoughts on the Kyria keyboard which I've used for the past 3-4 days now and also my thoughts on split boards as a whole. Please note that all of that I am saying is <b>personal preference.</b> If you like something, I may not like it or vice versa. With that said, I'll start with the Kyria first:</p>

	<p>It's a nice concept. The row stagger works pretty well in terms of comfort and there is a certain flexibility when it comes to adjusting your keyboard (because it is two halves, after all). However, there are a bunch of things about the keyboard that made me go back to my trusty Filco. I'll list them as follows and then go into detail for each thing I'm pointing out.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Thumb clusters are cool, but I'm unsure about spacebar placement</li>
		<li>I really, really need a numbers row, I've realized</li>
		<li>I have no idea where to put backspace and enter</li>
		<li><b>Random input drops</b></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Thumb clusters</h3>
	<p>They're pretty damn nice. I like the idea of being able to do a bunch of things with your thumb, where on regular keyboards, all it does is, well, press space. Having a bunch of hotkeys at your thumb is very handy for things like screenshotting and whatnot. However, of course, you still need a spacebar. I've put in one 2u key on each side because of it, but it just feels odd to have the spacebar aligned that way compared to a normal spacebar. I've then tried a 1u spacebar and while it feels nice at first, eventually my hand feels a bit cramped. Also, since I don't really have a clever way of putting enter where it normally would be, it's on the thumb cluster too, which is kinda confusing, I'll talk more about that later.</p>

	<h3>Numbers row</h3>
	<p>I need one. Period. I cannot get used to it being behind a function layer, regardless of whether it's behind a numpad on my right hand or a full numbers row on the home row, both using a function key. It's just confusing and my head refuses to switch. I've tried very hard, believe me. I just really, really need a numbers row in order to keep thing as non confusing for me as possible.</p>

	<h3>Backspace/Enter locations</h3>
	<p>As I said in the first section, I have no clever location for enter... or backspace, really. It just confuses me a lot and I result in a lot of typos because of it. I look for the backspace key, turns out I hit shift by accident, or when pressing space, it actually turned out to be enter. Granted, this may very well be my own fault because I've messed with my own layout a lot, but having those things on the thumbs just seemed the most logical and efficient. My brain however refuses to work that way.</p>

	<h3>Random input drops</h3>
	<p>This is the big one. I've had inputs drop during speedruns of mine at complete random and I cannot figure out why. I reflashed my keyboard, I've used different configuration parameters to try and mitigate it somehow but it'd just keep coming back at some point, which is very annoying. I have no idea where this issue is from and whether it's the firmware or some sort of hardware defect, but I'm too tired to try and experiment further with it. In fact, during a speedrun session of mine, when the input drops were happening, I ended up just switching back to my Filco because it didn't have these issues. I will not blame the PCB or the manufacturing or whatever here, because I cannot pinpoint where the issue is coming from. This may very well be a case of PEBCAK, for what it's worth.</p>

	<hr />

	<p>Anyways, those are the bad points about the Kyria. Mind you, I do enjoy the columnar stagger itself quite a bit, even if it took a bit to get used to, and the idea of thumb clusters letting you do more with your thumb is pretty dang nice. However, overall I think this keyboard just isn't for me. It's in no way representative of the quality of the product, it's just how I personally feel about it. So now, what are my plans for future keyboards?</p>

	<p>Well, there are a few. Using the Kyria has made me realize that I really don't like using heavy linear switches (I have Gateron Black Ink switches in mine), or linears overall for that matter. I may try using a light tactile switch again, like 62g Boba U4/U4T. Sound is cool and all but doesn't matter much, I wear headphones anyways. Even then, I have keebwerk Tacit switches inside my Filco, so I'm pretty used to that kinda switch, and I really like it. As for what form factor, I was thinking of getting the YMDK Wings (or any other Arisu-Layout keyboard that I can find), a split 75% or a planck-like ortholinear keyboard with 75 keys on it, so it's technically split by 3 keys in the middle, has dedicated arrow keys and a bunch of hotkeys in the middle, and a number row that I really need. I am not sure what I will pick next however, so we shall see.</p>

	<p>But bottom line is, the Kyria is a cool idea and I liked it at first, but now I'm just kinda "meh" about it and kinda wish I got something else. At least I tried it for myself to realize that hyper-efficient small keyboards are not for me.</p>
